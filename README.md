# Conquer Neural Network

Codes for paper **Conquer the Quantile: Convolution-smoothed Quantile Regression with Neural Networks and Minimax Guarantees** submitted to ICLR 2026.

Our conquer method is implemented in `python/conquer_model.py`. Run `python/benchmark_multiprocess.py` to get tables for MSEs and running times. Run `python/visualize.py` to get figures for running times and loss curves.

## Requirements

`python3` is required. Related packages required: `pytorch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
